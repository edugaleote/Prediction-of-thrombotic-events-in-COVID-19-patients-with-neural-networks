<h1>Prediction of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients with neural networks</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pandemic due to this virus started in 2019. Since then there have been a total of 7 million deaths. Various drugs and vaccines have been tested to prevent this number from increasing as rapidly as it has in recent years. During these years, it has been observed that patients with COVID-19 infection tend to have an increased risk of thrombotic events. These include venous and arterial thromboses. Thrombi can lead to different diseases depending on the level of involvement such as stroke, infarction, ischemia, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary thromboembolism. We have tried to identify the risk factors for these events in patients with COVID-19, which could help physicians in the prevention, early identification and management of the disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and improve clinical outcomes in these patients. 
<br /><br />Based on a database from the Hospital Universitario La Paz. This is a database produced by the cardiology service in which they recorded almost 500 variables of each patient hospitalized during the first three months. We want to find a neural network that can accurately predict the development of thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients.
<h2>Methodology</h2>
The database we started from contained many blank characters and variables with little information. This type of data is not suitable for training a neural network, so a debugging and statistical study was carried out. Later we started with the development of the neural networks. The number of hyperparameters to be modified in a network is immense.
The dedication to testing and training these networks has been considerable in the project. Different parameters and structures have been tested to find the optimal one to solve our problem with the lowest possible error.
We found a neural network with the parameters shown in the following table that manages to predict the development of thromboembolic events with an accuracy of 96.7%. Obtaining a mean square error of 0.0308.
